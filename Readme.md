# Traffic Routing System (Dijkstra + Flask)

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
This is a simple Python project I built to simulate a traffic routing system. Think of it like Google Maps, but super stripped down and totally offline. It uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm under the hood to find the shortest path between locations (nodes), and itâ€™s powered by Flask so you can interact with it through a neat little API.

## What This Does

- Lets you load a road network (as a graph)
- Uses Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to figure out the shortest route from a given starting point
- Exposes an endpoint so you can test it through your browser or Postman
- Code is modularâ€”easy to read and tweak

I built this mainly to brush up on graphs, algorithms, and for experiencing working with Flask.
